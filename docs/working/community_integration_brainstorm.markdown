#Symphony Community+Docs Integration Brainstorm#

*Ideas / quick fixes to get the community better involved in the documentation process — preferably to get some results without having to dramatically architect new tools.*

##Simple:##
* Add a “how-to” category for forum posts.
* Add predefined tags to forum posts so users can tag individual posts with relevant topics.
* Add a “submit to docs” button on posts. This would let users recommend content to the docs WG.
* Provide an obvious way for interested users to submit articles or tutorials to the existing site. (Front end form?)

##Moderate:##
* Add user rating or voting on forum posts, and assets (extensions and utilities.)
* Allow inline commenting on the official docs, like php.net. Or, suggestions — like the issue tracker (@czheng.)
* Allow users to browse forum posts by popularity; presumably most viewed, or best rated.

##Extreme:##
* Create a completely separate forum specifically for tutorial/how-to posts.
* Add a user-editable section (moderated or unmoderated) in the Learn section.
* Set up a managed wiki.
* Build a Symphony Ensemble for the documentation workflow that incorporates revisions, moderation, and community input.
* Create a vote-to-promote section as a vehicle (separate from forum) for more specific community support issues.
